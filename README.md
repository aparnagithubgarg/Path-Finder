# Path Finding Visualizer

A interactive web application that visualizes Dijkstra's algorithm finding the shortest path on a weighted grid. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization**: Watch the algorithm find the shortest path in real-time
- **Weighted Grid**: Each node has random weights (1-100) affecting path cost
- **Interactive Controls**: Start visualization and reset the grid
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Step-by-step Animation**: See the algorithm explore nodes progressively
- **Optimal Path Highlighting**: Final path displayed in contrasting color

## How to Use
- **Initial Setup:** The grid automatically generates with random weights

- **Start Visualization:** Click the "Start" button to begin Dijkstra's algorithm

- **Watch the Process:**

  Light green nodes are being explored

  Light red nodes have been visited

  Yellow path shows the optimal route

- **Reset:** Click "Refresh" to generate a new random grid
